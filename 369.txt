In one of the previous programs where we were reading frrom a JSON file, some of the code was written in the `with` block. It is possible to improve the program so that we can close the file as soon as possible, immediately after we read and parsed JSON.

Just create a new variable before the `with` block, and move the printing code out of it. So simple.
