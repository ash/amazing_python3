This program lists all files and all directories located in the current directory. It uses the `listdir` function from the `os` built-in module.

When you call `os.listdir('.')`, you get a list of all items in the current directory, which includes both file names and directory names that are located here. `'.'` refers to the current directory.

You donâ€™t need to install the `os` module, as it is included in Python distribution.
