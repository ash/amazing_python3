The `secrets` module in Python uses the most secure ways of the system to generate random sequences. You can use this module to get random numbers, which in theory may be more random than those generated by the `random` module.

In this program, the `randbelow` function is used. It returns a random integer number below its argument, which is `1000` in our case.

Run the progam a few times to ses the differet series of random integers in the output.
