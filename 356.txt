In this program, we are solving the same problem as before, but this time, the factors of the integer are found using the so-called list comprehension. The `[n for n in range...` construct creates a list of numbers that pass a condition `...if N % n == 0`.

Notice that there is another change comparing to the previous program. Namely, the upper edge of the range is roughly half of `N`, as there's no chance that a bigger number can be a factor of `N`.
