Redis is an in-memody key-value storage, which can replace SQL databases or caching services in many cases. Python can work with Redis via a module named `redis`. Install it with pip: `pip3 install redis`. 

To connect to a Redis server, call `redis.Redis()`. It also takes a few paramters such as `host` and `port` if you need to set them to non-default values.

Then, we save a value under the `my:key` key, and later read it. This is the simplest two methods in Redis. We could cover more in future posts.

To run this program, you need to have Redis itself installed and running, of course. Refer to https://redis.io to see installations instructions for your operating system.
