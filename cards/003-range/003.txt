The built-in `range` function can be used in three different ways. First, when it is called with a single argument `range(N)`, it generates the range of integers starting from 0 and going up to `N` but does not include `N`. With the two arguments `range(N, M)`, the range goes from `N` up to `M` and again it does not include `M`. If you pass three arguments `range(N, M, S)`, then the third argumennt defines the step or the increment value that the output number receive. Note that you can use negatie steps, in which case you count downwards.
