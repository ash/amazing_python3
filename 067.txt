Using the "cmath" module to replace a traditional "math" when you need to deal with complex numbers. The rest remains the same. Here is a program that solves a square equation when its discriminant is negative. Only change math to cmath and you are done!

import cmath
def solve(a, b, c): d = cmath.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c) x1 = (-b - d) / (2 * a) x2 = (-b + d) / (2 * a) return x1, x2

x1, x2 = solve(1, 2, 3)
print(x1)
print(x2)
