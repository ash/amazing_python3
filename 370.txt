In Python 3.9, we have the new methods `removeprefix` and `removesuffix` that you can apply to strings. In the given example, you can see how the methods remove the corresponding part of the word and return a new string.

These methods simplify the cases when you need to remove the part on the edge of the string: now, you donâ€™t need to compute the length, take a substing using a range etc.
