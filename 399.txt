Generator expressions are similar to what you may have seen in list comprehension. It this program, such an expression is used directly inside the call of `sum` and produces a sequence of squares `n * n` for the given range from 1 up to and including 10. The program prints 385, which is a sum of those squares: 1 + 4 + 9 + ... + 81 + 100.
