The problem: you are given a list of lists of integers, and you need to find how many times `5` appears in this data structure. There maximum depth of nested lists is 1.

The solution: flatten the lists to a single list that contains all the numbers and then apply the `count` method to it.

In this solution, a trick `sum(data, [])` is used to flatten the lists. See more about it at https://www.instagram.com/p/CIbnomKgJTj/
