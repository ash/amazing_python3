In this program, we get a string containing a few integer numbers separated by comma, and we need to get a list of those integers as a list of integer, not a list of strings.

A na√Øve splitting by comma returns a list of strings, obviously. What you need is to call the `int` built-in function to convert each substring to an integer. To simplify the code and avoid explicit loops, use the `map` function. It will call `int` for each of the elements that `data.split(',')` returns.
