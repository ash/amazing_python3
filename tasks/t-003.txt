Here, the three different methods to get a fractional part of a number are shown. For the input number 10.75, the expected result of the program is to print 0.75.

In the first method, the modulo operator is used: `number % 1`. In the second method, the integer part of the number is subtracted: `number - int(number)`. Note that `int(number)` only takes the integer part and does not round the number.

In the third method, the function of the `math` module is used: `math.modf(number)`. The function returns a two-item tuple with the fractional and integer parts of the number. As we are going to ignore the integer part, the dummy variable `_` is used.

When working with this code, donâ€™t forget that floating-point arithmetics is not 100% precise and for some input numbers you can get numbes such as `0.2599999999999998`.
