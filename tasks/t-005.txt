The task here is to find and print all letters that appear in both input words. For the given examples, "hello" and "world", the common letters are "l" and "o".

First, the words are independently converted to sets, which splits the words into letters and keeps only one copy of each letter. So, if you print the variable `in_a`, you will see `{'l', 'o', 'h', 'e'}`, where "l" appears only once.

Second, make the intersection of the two sets by using the `intersection` set method. And thatâ€™s it!
