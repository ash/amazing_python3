Here is a simple implementaition of a linked list. First, we define the class `Node` that represents the items (nodes) of the list. Each node has its value (`self.value`) and a reference to the next node (`self.next`). Then, we create the head node and set its value to 10. The node is saved in the `head` variable. After than, we create a few more nodes with different values from 20 to 50, create the objects of the `Node` type, and append them to the last item of the current linked list. Notice that on each iteration, the `curr` value points to the most recently created node.

In the second part of the program, we traverse the list and print the values in the nodes. Again, we start with the `head` element, and then set `curr` to the next node by reading the `curr.next` attribute of the current node. When `curr.next` becomes `None`, we reached the last node and thus can stop.
