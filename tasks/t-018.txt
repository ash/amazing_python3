In this problem, you have to generate and print the names of the first 70 Excel columns. The columns in Excel are labeled with one or more letters from A to Z. The first 26 columns get one-letter names A, B, C, ... Z. Then, the column names receive the second letter in the same manner decimal numbers above 9 get the second digit. So, the columns are named AA, AB, AC, and so on to AZ, which is followed by BA, BB, BC. After you reach ZZ, the column gets the third letter: AAA, AAB, AAC, etc.

In this program, we are printing the first 70 column names. For each `n`, the name is prepared from the least significant character and is assembled in the `col` variable. The current digit is evaluated by modulo division 26 (which is the number of letters in English alphabet) and converting the number to a character: `chr(x - 1 + ord('A'))`. Then the number is divided by 26 and the procedure is repeated for the second digit. The loop is stopped when the number after division is small enough to represent only a single letter.
