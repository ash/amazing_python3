Here is a possible solution of the classical interview task of printing "fizz" and "buzz" in response to the number. If the number is divisible by 3 you print "fizz" and if it is divisible by 5, you print "buzz".

The trick is that you have to remember that some numbers are divisible by both 3 and 5 (such as 15). For such numbers, you print "fizzbuzz".

Here, there are two solutions. The first one only checks the numbers for their divisibility by 3 and then by 5, while the second solution optimizes the process a bit by immediately checking for divisibility by 15.
