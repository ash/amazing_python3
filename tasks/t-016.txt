Here is a classical method of de-duplicating lists in Python. You’ve got a list of numbers, and you need to remove items that repeat in it. First, convert the list to a set. By doing so, you automatically remove duplicates, as sets can only keep a single copy of each value. The second step is obvious: convert a set back to a list. After that, you’ve got a list with the elements from the set, so all of them are different. The only downside of the method is that you are not guaranteed that the order of the elements in the new list is the same as in the original one. If you are not required to keep it, you are good. If not, we’ll need to modify the algorithm.
