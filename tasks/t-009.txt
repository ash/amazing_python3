In this problem, you have a list of numbers and you have to find all local maxima (or maximums if you prefer). A local maximum is the number that is bigger than both of its neighbours. The first and the last numbers in the list are not maxima.

In the solution, we scan all the indices (or indexes if you prefer) of the data list starting from 1 and ending at `len(data) - 1`. Thus, we ignore the first and the last items by that. Then, we make a test and see if the value at the current position `i` (which is `data[i]`) is bigger than its left `data[i-1]` and right `data[i+1]` neighbour. If that is True, we print and report that we found a local maxumum of that value at that position.
