The task today is to cound all Christmas days that fall on Sunday in the years between 1900 and 2100 (including both).

We are using the `datetime` module and create a date object with it: `datetime.datetime(year, 12, 25)`. These dates are always December 25 but with different years. Then we determing the week day by calling the `weekday()` method and if it is Sunday (which is 6), you increment the counter. Thatâ€™s it!

Note that in the range you need to have the right edge one year bigger than your desired last year in the list.
