Pythonâ€™s built-in module `dbm` allows using the so-called Unix databases, or "DBM databases". They are usefule if you want to organise a simple storage of some data locally on a disk.

In the program, two parts are shown: first, we open a database and write some values there. Then, the database is open again and the values are read from there.

The `'c'` mode opens the base for both reading and writing. It also creates it if it does not exist so far. In the rest, using the `db` variable is similar to using Python dictionaries.
