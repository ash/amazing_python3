In this program, we are taking a list of numbers (`data`) and print all possible combinations that contain three different items from the list. To simplify the task, the built-in `itertools` module is used. This module contains the `combinations` function, that we actually use. You need to pass an iterable object and the length of the resulting items. And thatâ€™s it!
