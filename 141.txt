If, for some reasons, you need to call a regular class method as a static method (in other words, you do not have an object to pass to "self"), use the @classmethod decorator to ask Python to generate correct arguments when calling the method. Python will substitute the class type to "self". And for the oppisite case, use @staticmethod to omit the "self" parameter, which makes able to call a method on a class instead of an object. Be careful and think about the "self" value in this case if you use such approach.
