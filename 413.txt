Here is a program that takes a list of lists of integers and makes a single flat list out of this data. By flattening we mean that all the elements in the resulting array are located on the same depth of 1.

The process is simple: first, loop over the first-level internal lists, then list over the elements in those lists. Finally, append the deepest item to the `result` list. 

If you have a construction with more levels, you probably would like to use a recursive function.
