In this program, we are using the code from a previously published task, where the goal was to find the minimum and maximum of a list of integers without using Python built-in functions such as `min` and `max`. In the comments, one of the subscribers noted that we do not actually need an index inside the loop, so we donâ€™t have to iterate over the range of indices and can loop over the elements of the data list directly. This is what is done here. Another tiny addition is to replace the second `if` with `elif` as the conditions are mutally exclusive. Note that the `min` and `max` values are initially set to the first item of a list, and that value is still (uselessly) checked in the loop. So we could probably loop over `data[1:]` instead.
