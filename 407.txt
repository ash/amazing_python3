In Python, you can define what the `len` function retunrs when it is applied to an object of your class. In this example, we created a simple class to keep a phrase. We also want the `len` returns the number of words in the phrase. To do that, the `__len__` method is added to the class. It takes the phrase, counts the number of spaces in it, and return that number + 1. So, in the simplest case, if we ignore all the punctuation, we get the number of words, which is the number of spaces plus one.
