To determine if a given year is a leap year or not, you can manipulate the numbers such as divide it by 4 and by 100 and by 1000 and finally make some conclusions, but you also can use the built-in `calendar` module that has the `isleap` function, which does the job.

In this program, we print the years which are leap in the interval between 2020 and 2030 (not including 2030, which isnâ€™t leap anyways).
