In this program, there is a mistake. We created a dictionary with a couple of elements, and then try to add the third element. But instead of `=`, a colon `:` was typed. Python did not report about any errors, neither compile-time, nor at runtime. But the third element, of course, was not added to the dictionary.

What happened, how do you think?
