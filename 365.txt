In the program published yesterday, there are a couple of momements that we can improve. First, remove the unused loop variable and raplace `n` with a dummy variable `_`. It is required here as parrt of Python syntax, but we are actually not using its value anywhere in the loop. Second, the constructs such as `x = x + y` can be rewritten with less characters using the so-called augmented assignment operators: `x += y`.
